## Overview

NextRole AI automates the legwork of researching technical roles. Given a job query, the system:

- Generates a targeted search string (with optional recency filter).
- Collects search results from reputable job boards (LinkedIn Jobs, Greenhouse, Lever, etc.).
- Crawls candidate pages, filters out inactive or non-specific listings.
- Uses an LLM to extract structured job data.
- Produces a market-level summary of top skills, tech stacks, and trends.
- Surfaces everything in a modern React interface.

The project is split into a FastAPI backend (agent pipeline + REST API) and a Vite/React frontend.

---

## Key Features

- **LangGraph Agent Pipeline** orchestrating planning, search, crawl, parsing, analysis, and persistence.
- **Advanced Search & Time Filters** leveraging Tavily's API for precise, recent results.
- **LLM-powered Job Parsing** with guardrails to discard lists/articles or closed positions.
- **MongoDB Persistence** for search queries, parsed job posts, and summaries.
- **Responsive Frontend** with live polling, status updates, and actionable job tables.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Node.js 18+** (for Vite)
- **MongoDB** URI (Atlas or local)
- **OpenAI API key** (model defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`; adjust as needed)
- **Tavily API key**

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Bootstrap

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/nextrole-ai.git
cd nextrole-ai
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `backend/` with the following keys (placeholder values shown):

```
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
MONGODB_DB_NAME=your_database_name_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # Optional override
APP_URL = "" #for deployment purposes
```

### 3. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Key endpoints:

- `POST /api/search-jobs` — start a new job search.
- `GET /api/search-jobs/{search_query_id}` — poll for status/results.

### 4. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The UI runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5173` by default.

---

## Usage

1. Open the frontend and enter job title, experience band, location, and optional time filter.
2. Submit to kick off the agent pipeline; the form disables while searching.
3. The status banner updates (`PLANNING`, `SEARCHING`, `CRAWLING`, etc.).
4. Once complete, the analysis panel and job listings populate with actionable data.

## Extending the Agent

- **Additional Sources:** Plug in more job boards by expanding the search prompt or crawling logic.
- **Enhanced Filters:** Accept salary, role level, or tech keywords and feed them into `planner_node`.
- **Notifications:** Add webhooks or email alerts when new jobs meet criteria.
- **Analytics:** Persist more metadata (salary, remote status, etc.) and enrich the summary.

Because the agent uses LangGraph, you can add new nodes (e.g., deduplication, recruiter email extraction) with minimal changes to surrounding code.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                                       | Possible Fix                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Import "fastapi" could not be resolved`    | Ensure the backend virtualenv is activated and dependencies installed.                                  |
| 404 when polling search ID                  | Confirm the insert step succeeded (check backend logs for Mongo errors).                                |
| Empty results / "No job postings available" | Verify Tavily API quota, consider adjusting filters or time range.                                      |
| LLM context errors                          | The agent truncates content to ~15k chars but you can reduce `page_content` slice further if necessary. |
| Mongo auth failures                         | Revisit `MONGODB_URI`/`MONGODB_DB_NAME` values in `.env`.                                               |

Happy hiring (or job hunting)! 🎯

## How It Works: The Agent Pipeline

The core of NextRole AI is a multi-agent system orchestrated by LangGraph. When a search is submitted, it kicks off a stateful workflow where specialized agents collaborate to find and process information.

1.  **Planner Agent:** The process begins here. This agent takes the user's input (job title, experience, location) and formulates a precise, strategic search query, including filters for job boards and time.

2.  **Search Agent:** Using the plan, this agent connects to the **Tavily API** to execute the web search. It retrieves a list of relevant URLs along with pre-processed page content.

3.  **Refiner Agent (The Self-Correction Loop):** This is where the system's intelligence shines. If the initial search yields too few results, LangGraph routes the workflow to this agent. It improves the query by adding keywords like "remote" or "startup" and sends it **back to the Search Agent** for another attempt. This loop ensures the agent is resilient and doesn't give up easily.

4.  **Parsing Agent:** Once a sufficient number of results are found, this agent acts as a quality control expert. It uses an LLM to analyze each page to verify it's a single, active job posting (filtering out articles, lists, or closed positions). If valid, it extracts key data like title, company, location, and the apply link into a structured format.

5.  **Analysis Agent:** With a clean list of verified jobs, this final agent synthesizes the data. It identifies the top skills and tech stacks mentioned across all postings and generates a concise market summary.

This entire process, from planning to analysis, is autonomous, stateful, and designed to turn the unstructured chaos of the web into structured, actionable intelligence.
